  <b>Repetition as a Third Mode of Interaction in Reinforcement Learning</b>
</p>

---

# Overview

`Repetition` is a reinforcement learning research framework that introduces **repetition as a third mode of interaction** alongside:

* Exploration
* Exploitation

Traditional off-policy RL algorithms reuse past experiences only during optimisation through replay-buffer sampling. In contrast, Repetition directly modifies the interaction process itself by allowing agents to deliberately re-execute previously valuable behaviours in the environment.

The framework studies how repeating successful trajectories during interaction can improve:

* sample efficiency
* behavioural consolidation
* exploration guidance
* stability of learning

This repository includes implementations of:

* **IER**: Instant Episode Repetition
* **SER**: Spaced Episode Repetition

  * **ESER**: Episode-based SER
  * **XSER**: Transition-based SER
  * **MSER**: Mixed SER

The framework is evaluated on continuous-control RL benchmarks and robotic manipulation tasks.

# Core Idea

In standard RL, agents alternate between:

1. **Exploration**

   * discovering new behaviours

2. **Exploitation**

   * following the current policy

This work introduces:

3. **Repetition**

   * deliberate re-execution of previously successful behaviours

Unlike replay buffers that only reuse transitions during gradient optimisation, repetition changes how the agent interacts with the environment itself.

---

# Methods

# Instant Episode Repetition (IER)

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/IER.png" width="80%">
</p>

IER immediately repeats newly discovered valuable episodes.

When a useful trajectory is detected, the corresponding action sequence is re-executed directly in the environment for several repetitions.

## Key Characteristics

* immediate behavioural reinforcement
* no additional episodic memory required
* lightweight integration into off-policy RL
* suitable for fast-learning environments

## IER Selection Strategies

### Episode-Reward IER

Episodes are selected using cumulative episode reward.

This reinforces globally successful trajectories.

### Transition-Reward IER

Episodes are selected using high local transition rewards.

This captures locally important experiences even when the full episode return is not optimal.

---

# Spaced Episode Repetition (SER)

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/SER.png" width="85%">
</p>

SER introduces delayed behavioural reuse through a long-term episodic memory called:

> **Virtual Episode Memory (VEM)**

Instead of repeating trajectories immediately, SER periodically revisits valuable episodes according to a repetition schedule.

## Why SER?

SER separates discovery and reuse over time.

This enables:

* delayed behavioural consolidation
* periodic trajectory reinforcement
* long-term reuse of important behaviours
* reduced dependence on recent experience only

---

# SER Variants

# ESER

## Episode-Based SER

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/ESER.png" width="45%">
</p>

ESER stores episodes according to cumulative episode reward:

```math
R_i^{ep} > R_{max}^{ep}
```

The method prioritises globally successful trajectories across the entire episode.

---

# XSER

## Transition-Based SER

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/XSER.png" width="45%">
</p>

XSER selects episodes using locally important transition rewards.

Instead of relying only on total episode return, XSER captures trajectories containing important local events.

This is useful when sparse or local rewards are important for learning.

---

# MSER

## Mixed SER

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/MIXSER.png" width="60%">
</p>

MSER combines:

* global episode-reward selection
* local transition-reward selection

This enables the framework to preserve:

* globally successful trajectories
* locally salient experiences

Two mixed variants are included:

* `mixed`
* `simple_mixed`
